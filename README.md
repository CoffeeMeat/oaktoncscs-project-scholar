A web application that helps students in their college search by recommending colleges from across the country based on their grades, academic interest, extracurricular activities, lifestyle, location, etc.

Target audience: College applicants

Requirements for development: A laptop and a motivation to learn and contribute. No experience is required to contribute. For beignners and
advanced developers alike, there'll always be ways for you to contribute to this project.

Target task for those who are experienced in Java:
  - For those who are experienced in Java, I want you guys to focus on the Controller Servlet and Model class development. Here,
  you guys will be focusing on the business logic that goes behind acquiring and adding the data that is needed. Whether it be
  injecting new users into the SQL database, retrieving user data from these databases, or querying colleges from an external 
  database.

Target task for those who don't know anything about Java:
  - For those who don't know Java, it'll be hard for you to contribute to the server-side development of the Controller Servlet and model.
  That's why I would like you guys to focus on the front-end development (HTML, CSS, Javascript) of webpages. The reason for this
  is that these three languages, in my opinion, are extremely easy for you guys to learn on your own. There is a ubiquity
  of online sources that can teach you everything you need to know about frontend development with these languages. This portion of
  the project is extremely important as we want people to feel comfortable and engaged in interacting with our web app. A great
  resource for learning practically everything you need to know is located here https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web. Your
  main job is to research front end web page development on this site, learn a lot of stuff, and apply that studd into creating
  new web pages and making them look awesome.
